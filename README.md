Hello! I created this HTML based generic error page for my website (https://notsim.uno/error) and decided to post it on GitHub so that everyone who might need a error page can download it.

If you think this is useful, you're free to download it and use it as u wish, I'd like you to link my website for credits but do as you want, I don't really care tbh
If you think this is useless why are you here reading this?

Thanks for reading allat
